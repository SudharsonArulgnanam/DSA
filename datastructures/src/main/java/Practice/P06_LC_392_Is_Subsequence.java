public class P06_LC_392_Is_Subsequence {

	/*
	 * Problem Statement:
	 * Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, 
	 * or false otherwise.A subsequence of a string is a new string that is 
	 * formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the 
	 * characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining 
	 * characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
	 *
	 *  
	 * 1) Did I understand the problem? Yes or No !! - Yes 
	 * -> If No, Ask the person to provide more detail with example(s) 
	 * -> If yes, go to next step !!
	 * 
	 * What is the input(s)? - String
	 * What is the expected output? - Boolean 
	 * Do I have constraints to solve the problem? - 
	 * Do I have all informations to go to next step!!
	 * How big is your test data set will be?
	 *
	 *
	 * 2) Test Data Set
	 *  Minimum of 3 data set !!
	 *   
	 *  Positive :  s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
	 *   
	 *  Edge     :  s = "abc", t = "ahbbgdc"
	 *  
	 *  Negative :  s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
	 *  
	 *  Validate the data set with the interviewer 
	 *
	 * 3) Do I know how to solver it?
	 *	Yes - great, Is there any alternate solution?
	 *	No - Can I break down the problem to sub problems?
	 *
	 * 4) Ask for the hint (If you don't know how to solve it)
	 *
	 *
	 * 5) Do I know alternate solution to solve this problem? - yes
	 *	Yes - What are those? 
	 *	No ï¿½ That is still fine, proceed to solve by what you know !!
	 *
	 *  Simple Technique - > Brute Force !!
	 *  
	 * 6) If you know alternate solutions -> find out the O Notations (Performance)
	 *  Approach 1:
	 *
	 * 7) Start with Pseudo code
	 * 		a.
	 * 		
	 * 8)Implement the code
	 * 
	 * 9)Test against the different data set
	 * 
	 * 10) If it fails Debug them to solve it !!
